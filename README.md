# Nutrition_Fact_App 
Build your own  nutrition fact database and calculate the nutrition value of your own recipe.

ps. It was a little tool that I make for my friend and also my ex-collegue Lulu to speed up her work as a functional food formula R&D. This explains why there are greetings in my apps, because it's a gift. ^___^

●I use tkinter to build the UI.

●Then I use Pyinstaller to pack the apps.
